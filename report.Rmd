# Welcome to Assignment 4

## Before we begin

Unlike Assignments 1-3, you will no longer be provided with the RMarkdown code.
All of the code blocks here are empty and accompanied by instructions for what
is expected in the code block. Do not neglect your `main.R` skeleton file as the
functions there will constitute most of the points you earn.

_THE BULK OF YOUR GRADE WILL BE ON YOUR WORK IN `main.R`_

Anything that is specified to occur in functions you create MUST be in the
`main.R` file. While you theoretically CAN do some or all of the homework in
this .Rmd file, it is bad practice to have your 'back end' coding in the same
files as your 'front end' report. Your `report.html` may be referenced to
visually check any graphical outputs you may generate for this and all future
assignments, but your `main.R` functions will be run outside of their respective
markdown environments when grading them.

```{r setup, include=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Source your main

```

## 1.  Reading and filtering count data

To begin, let's read in the raw count matrix, named `verse_counts.tsv`, as a
`tibble` by implementing the `read_data()` function in `main.R`. Then filter out
all zero-variance genes with the `filter_zero_var_genes()` function, also in
`main.R`. Filtering out zero-variance genes is necessary for several common
analysis steps, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and can be helpful
to reduce the size of our dataset if memory issues are a constraint.

### 1a. import data
```{r}
#Read in verse_counts.tsv and display the head of the resulting tibble

#Display the top 10 rows of verse counts
```

### 1b. Apply filter_zero_var_genes()
```{r}
#Filter out zero variance genes using the function you created in `main.R

#display the head of the counts data from the zero variance filter function's output
```

## 2. Constructing sample meta data from sample names

It’s often beneficial to separate data modes from each other during analysis (
i.e. to have one data frame containing gene expression data, and separate data
frame for any gene or subject level information). Here we’ll construct a
`tibble` from sample names- which are located in the columns of our count
matrix. To help you along, `main.R` has the two helper functions for you to
implement first, `timepoint_from_sample` which extracts the ages of the subjects
(P0, P4, P7, and Ad) from the sample names and `sample_replicate` which extracts
the sample replicate number ("1" or "2"). Then, use these functions to implement
the `meta_info_from_labels` function and extract the sample name, timepoint, and
replicate number from each sample name. The function should then return a tibble
with all the relevant information.

```{r}
#Create and display the sample meta data tibble

```

## 3. Normalization

Often we will want to normalize gene counts between samples so that comparisons
are more reliable. Given read counts are a relative measure of abundance,
normalization is a necessary step during RNAseq analysis when samples may have
differing numbers of total reads.

### 3a. Normalizing with CPM (counts per million)

Now that we've explored our dataset prior to count normalization, we should
normalize our data to see how things change. A simple and intuitive approach to
count normalization is _counts per million_: that is finding the number of
counts for a given gene in a given sample for each million reads observed. It
can be easily calculated using this formula

$cpm = \frac{X_{i, j}}{\sum \limits_{i=1}^P X_{i, j}} \cdot 10^6$

Where $X$ is a $P \times N$ count matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns.

In other words, the counts per million is 10^6 * (percentage of reads that a
gene represents in the sample's library).
Therefore, for any gene within a sample, the CPM is calculated with: (#read for
sample)/(#total reads for all filtered genes in sample) * 10^6

#### Plot library size

Implement the `get_library_size()` function and create a barplot of the number
of millions of reads per sample. You may either create your own function to make
the barplot or write the code in the RMarkdown at your discretion.

```{r}
#Calculate the number of reads in each sample and plot as a barplot

#Make a barplot showing the number of millions of reads for each sample
```

#### CPM calculation

Implement the `normalize_by_cpm` function to normalize a raw count matrix given
the provided formula.

```{r}
#Normalize your filtered counts matrix with CPM and display the head

```

### 3b. Normalizing with DESeq2

DESeq2 is a common and prolific tool for performing differential expression
analysis (DEA) in RNAseq data. Within that process, DESeq2 implements its own
normalization procedure prior to performing DEA for more reliably identified
differential genes. You can read more about it
[here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#data-transformations-and-visualization).

#### Normalizing with DESeq2

Implement the `deseq_normalize()` function to compute and extract the normalized
counts using DESeq2. The `DESeq2DataSet` object requires a design
formula to be specified. This formula is used as the differential expression
model, but [we don't need to provide a formula to normalize counts](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#do-normalized-counts-correct-for-variables-in-the-design). You
may pass `~1` as the design formula to pass a trivial formula when creating the
`DESeq2DataSet` object.

```{r}
#Normalize your filtered data and display the head of the resulting tibble

```

## 4 Visualization

Now that the data has been filtered and normalized, plot your data in the
methods described below. Your filtered data will be plotted first. You will be
instructed to plot your CPM and DESeq-normalized afterwards, in part 5 and 6
below.

### 4a. Visualizing count distributions via boxplots
Implement the `plot_sample_distributions()` function using `ggplot2` to create
boxplots visualizing the read counts for each sample over all genes. Ensure the
function is able to scale the y-axis to $log10$ values if specified by the
`scale_y_axis` parameter. Color each boxplot by its respective sample name.

```{r}
#Create and display your count distributions boxplot

```

### 4b. Count variance vs mean count

Another aspect of RNAseq data that often needs to be accounted for the is
relationship between variance and mean expression: that is, more highly
expressed genes will exhibit higher variance values. This is problematic as
interesting patterns controlled by genes at naturally lower expression values
will be washed out by more highly expressed genes. To visualize this phenomenon,
implement the `plot_variance_vs_mean()` function to plot gene variance on the
y-axis vs mean count rank on the x-axis, where with $p$ genes, the most highly
expressed gene will have rank $p$ and the most lowly expressed gene will have
rank $1$.


```{r}
#Create and display your variance vs mean plot

```

### 4c. Visualizing patterns with PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimension reduction technique often used
to extract the most meaningful structure in a dataset to fewer dimensions. This
is incredibly useful when trying to visualize your data in only a few dimensions
(e.g. 2 PCs compared to 2000 genes), and when trying to build models with only a
few orthogonal data features. To visualize the structure in our dataset,
implement the `plot_pca()` function to both run PCA on a provided count matrix,
but then to also plot the first two PCs of the dataset using a scatterplot,
where each dot represents a sample and is colored by its respective sample name.

```{r}
#Create and display your PCA plot

```

### 5. Visualizing CPM

Visualize the effect of CPM normalization on the dataset by visualizing the
sample distributions, the relationship between variance and average expression
values, and plotting the samples along the first two PCs. Does the normalization
seem effective? What, if any, are the major differences observed between the
plots produced by raw counts?

#### CPM plots

Plot your CPM data using the same three functions you used in part 4 and display
your Sample Distribution, Variance vs Mean, and PCA plots. Direct the function
to `scale_y_axis` when calling functions that have that parameter.

```{r}
#Create and display 3 plots of your cpm matrix: Sample Distribution, Variance vs Mean, and PCA

```

### 6. Visualizing DESeq2 Normalizion

Visualize the effect of DESeq2 normalization on the dataset by visualizing the
sample distributions, the relationship between variance and average expression
values, and plotting the samples along the first two PCs. How does DESeq2
normalization compare to CPM? Raw values? Which method, if any, seems most
effective?

#### DESeq2 plots

Plot your DESeq2 data using the same three functions you used in part 4 and
display your Sample Distribution, Variance vs Mean, and PCA plots.

```{r}
#Create and display 3 plots of your deseq-normalized data: Sample Distribution, Variance vs Mean, and PCA

```
