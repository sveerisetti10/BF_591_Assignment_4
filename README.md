# bf591-assignment-4

Skeleton repo for bf591 assignment 4

### Repo contains:
  - main.R
  - README.md
  - example_report.html
  - report.Rmd
  - verse_counts.tsv

## Note to Students

For _this and all future assignments_, you will now have to code your markdown
file in addition to the `main.R` functions. The `report.Rmd` file still has the
same background and assignment information included and the R code blocks are
created, just like in previous assignments, but from now on they will devoid of
code.

Don't worry, there are instructions in `report.Rmd` to guide you through the
code blocks!
